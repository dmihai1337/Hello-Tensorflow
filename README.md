# Hello-Tensorflow

This is a replication of the Tensorflow Machine Learning Zero To Hero Tutorial on Youtube which I used for an introduction to Machine Learning. => https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvwWuPiWnuTDBHe7I0fMSsfO by Laurence Moroney

`ml_helloworld.py` - use a 1 neuron model to derive the formula y = 3x + 1 from given data sets\
`fashion.py` - train a model with pictures of clothes then query the model to predict the fashion object in a picture\
`image_filters.py` - experiment with convolution and max pooling on pictures\
`cnn.py` - first usage of a convolutional neural network to train a model for the same fashion exercise, the accuracy is much higher\
`rps.py` - use the Rock Paper Scissors data sets from the author to train the model to classify photos as hands showing either rock, paper or scissors.
